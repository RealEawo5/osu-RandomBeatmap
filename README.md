To use the program, bind the "randomMap.py" to a key or button on either your mouse or keyboard.


# mapSettins.csv

The first & second parameter in the "mapSettings.csv" is the start & end index of the range of beatmapID's the program randomly chooses from.

>:: NOTE! ::::</br>
>I recommend a range of **1,3333333** if you want the program to choose between almost all of the osu!beatmaps ever uploaded.</br>
>If you dont want any old maps, _approx. 2007-2014_, then i reccomend a range of **499999,3333333**.</br>
>If you want a selection of only old maps, then i'd recommend a range of **1,499999**.</br>

The third parameter in the "mapSettings.csv" is if you want a specific status on the beatmap as a parameter, eg. 'Ranked', 'Loved', etc...

>:: NOTE! ::::::::::::</br>
>The diffrent status parameters are as follows:</br>
> - _ranked_
> - _loved_
> - _qualified_
> - _wip_
> - _pening_
> - _graveyard_
>
>If you don't want any specified status as a parameter, then set th third parameter to _0_
>
>That being said;
>
>**I DO NOT RECOMMED YOU SPECIFY A BEATMAP STATUS OTHER THAN 'GRAVEYARD', DUE TO THE LIKLINESS OF GETTING A BEATMAP WITH ANY OTHER SPECIFICATION IS SO SMALL THAT YOU MIGHT GET A COOLDOWN ON ACCSESSIG THE https://osu.ppy.sh/b/ WEBSITE BEFORE A BEATMAP CAN BE FOUND.**

>This cooldown is to prevent DDoS attacks, and there is unfortunatly not anything i can do to prevent this from triggering. This cooldown causes a error with the program, and henche makeing the program not funcion properly for a breif perod of time. I dont have any excact data on how long this cooldown is, but you usually can accsess the webiste after 10-20min of getting this cooldown.</br>

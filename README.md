# osu-RandomBeatmap

# randomMap.py

To use the program, bind the "randomMap.py" to a key or button on either your mouse or keyboard.

>:: NOTE! ::::</br>
>If you find it annoying the a console window pops open every time you run the program, or the program seems to be working but doesn't type anything out in the osu chat; try adding a 'w' at the end of the file extention.</br>
></br>
>**_randomMap.py_** -> **_randomMap.pyw_**</br>
></br>
>If the program still doesn't work, then there is probably an issue with the libraries. The only fix to this that i know of is just to install the latest version of python via https://www.python.org/downloads/. If you do decide to download python, **_REMEBER TO CHECK OFF 'Add variable to Path' IN THE INSTALLATION PROCESS!_**</br>

# mapSettins.csv

The first & second parameter in the "mapSettings.csv" is the start & end index of the range of beatmapID's the program randomly chooses from.

>:: NOTE! ::::</br>
>I recommend a range of **1,3333333** if you want the program to choose between almost all of the osu!beatmaps ever uploaded.</br>
>If you dont want any old maps, _approx. 2007-2014_, then i reccomend a range of **499999,3333333**.</br>
>If you want a selection of only old maps, then i'd recommend a range of **1,499999**.</br>
>:::::::::::::::::::::
</br>
</br>

The third parameter in the "mapSettings.csv" is if you want a specific status on the beatmap as a parameter, eg. 'Ranked', 'Loved', etc...

>:: NOTE! ::::::::::::</br>
>The diffrent status parameters are as follows:</br>
> - _ranked_
> - _loved_
> - _qualified_
> - _wip_
> - _pening_
> - _graveyard_
>
>If you don't want any specified status as a parameter, then set th third parameter to _0_
>
>That being said;
>
>**I DO NOT RECOMMED YOU SPECIFY A BEATMAP STATUS OTHER THAN 'GRAVEYARD', DUE TO THE LIKLINESS OF GETTING A BEATMAP WITH ANY OTHER SPECIFICATION IS SO SMALL THAT YOU MIGHT GET A COOLDOWN ON ACCSESSIG THE https://osu.ppy.sh/b/ WEBSITE BEFORE A BEATMAP CAN BE FOUND.**

>This cooldown is to prevent DDoS attacks, and there is unfortunatly not anything i can do to prevent this from triggering. This cooldown causes a error with the program, and henche makeing the program not funcion properly for a breif perod of time. I dont have any excact data on how long this cooldown is, but you usually can accsess the webiste after 10-20min of getting this cooldown.</br>

The forth parameter in the "mapSettings.csv" is the run mode. **This is only ment for debugging!**

>:: NOTE! ::::::::::::</br>
>If you've accidentally changed it, simply set the last parameter to **0**, now if you for some reason want to run the program in debug mode, change this parameter to **1**.</br>
